#' Add Correlates of War state system codes to your data with Gleditsch-Ward state codes.
#'
#' @description
#'
#' \code{add_ccode_to_gw()} allows you to match, as well as one can, Correlates
#' of War system membership data with Gleditsch-Ward system data.
#'
#'
#' @return
#'
#' \code{add_ccode_to_gw()} takes a (dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year,
#' state-year) data frame that already has Gleditsch-Ward state system codes and
#' adds their corollary Correlates of War codes.
#'
#' @details The \code{data-raw} directory on the project's Github contains
#' more information about the underlying data that assists in merging in
#' these codes.
#'
#' The user will invariably need to be careful and ask why they want these
#' data included. The issue here is that both have a different composition
#' and the merging process will not (and cannot) be perfect. We can note
#' that a case like Gran Colombia is not too difficult to handle (i.e.
#' CoW does not have this entity and none of the splinter states conflict
#' with CoW's coding). However, there is greater weirdness with a case like
#' the unification of West Germany and East Germany. Herein, Correlates of
#' War treats the unification as the reappearance of the original Germany
#' whereas Gleditsch-Ward treat the unification as an incorporation of
#' East Germany into West Germany. The script will *not* create state-year
#' or dyad-year duplicates for the Gleditsch-Ward codes. The size of the
#' original data remain unchanged. However, there will be some year
#' duplicates for various Correlates of War codes (prominently Serbia
#' and Yugoslavia in 2006). Use with care. You can also use the
#' \pkg{countrycode} package. Whether you use this function or the
#' \pkg{countrycode} package, do *not* do this kind of merging without
#' assessing the output.
