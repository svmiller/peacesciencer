#' Add Correlates of War direct contiguity information to a data frame
#'
#' @description \code{add_contiguity()} allows you to add Correlates of War
#' contiguity data to a dyad-year, leader-year, or leader-dyad-year, or
#' state-year data frame.
#'
#' @return \code{add_contiguity()} takes a data frame and adds information
#' about the contiguity relationship based on the "master records" for the
#' Correlates of War direct contiguity data (v. 3.2). If the data are dyad-year
#' (or leader dyad-year), the function returns the lowest contiguity type
#' observed in the dyad-year (if contiguity is observed at all). If the data
#' are state-year (or leader-year), the data return the total number of
#' land and sea borders calculated from these master records.
#'
#'
#'
#' @details The contiguity codes in the dyad-year data range from 0 to 5.
#' 1 = direct land contiguity. 2 = separated by 12 miles of water or
#' fewer (a la Stannis Baratheon). 3 = separated by 24 miles of water or
#' fewer (but more than 12 miles). 4 = separated by 150 miles
#' of water or fewer (but more than 24 miles). 5 = separated by 400 miles
#' of water or fewer (but more than 150 miles).
#'
#' Importantly, 0 are the dyads that are not contiguous at all in the CoW
#' contiguity data. This is a conscious decision on my part as I do not think of
#' the CoW's contiguity data as exactly ordinal. Cross-reference CoW's contiguity
#' data with the minimum distance data in this exact package to see how some
#' dyads that CoW codes as not contiguous are in fact very close to each other,
#' sometimes even land-contiguous. For example, Zimbabwe and Namibia are separated
#' by only about a few hundred feet of water at that peculiar intersection of the
#' Zambezi River where the borders of Zambia, Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe
#' meet. There is no contiguity record for this in the CoW data. There are other
#' cases where contiguity records are situationally missing (e.g.
#' India-Bangladesh, and Bangladesh-Myanmar in 1971) or other cases where states
#' are much closer than CoW's contiguity data imply (e.g. Pakistan and the Soviet
#' Union were separated by under 30 kilometers of Afghani territory). The
#' researcher is free to recode these 0s to be, say, 6s, but this is why
#' \pkg{peacesciencer} does not do this.
#'
#' For additional clarity, the "master records" produce duplicates for cases when
#' the contiguity relationship changed in a given year. This function returns the
#' *minimum* contiguity relationship observed in that given year. There should be no
#' duplicates in the returned output.
#'
#' The `mry` argument works on an informal assumption that what CoW understands
#' as contiguity relationships is unchanged since the last data update on record.
#' This assumption is not problematic for composition/membership data, but it is
#' questionable in light of current events past the temporal reach of the project.
#' It is why the default is `FALSE` for this particular argument.
#'
#' Be mindful that the data are fundamentally state-year and that extensions to
#' leader-level data should be understood as approximations for leaders in a
#' given state-year.

#' @param data a data frame with appropriate \pkg{peacesciencer} attributes
#' @param mry logical, defaults to `FALSE`. If `TRUE`, the data carry forward the
#' identity of the major powers to the most recently concluded calendar year. If
#' `FALSE`, the panel honors the right bound of the data's temporal domain and
#' creates NAs for observations past it.
