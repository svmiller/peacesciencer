#' Add Correlates of War alliance data to a data frame
#'
#' @description
#'
#' `r lifecycle::badge("deprecated")`
#'
#' \code{add_cow_alliance()} allowed you to add Correlates of War alliance
#' data to a dyad-year data frame. However, this function is deprecated at the
#' request of the data set's maintainer and any use of the Correlates of War's
#' alliance data will have to be done manually. The function now returns a stop
#' communicating this development.
#'
#' @return
#'
#' \code{add_cow_alliance()} now returns a stop communicating the maintainer's
#' request to reject all software that facilitates the use of the data in this
#' fashion. \code{add_cow_alliance()} previously took a dyad-year data frame and
#' added information about the alliance pledge in that given dyad-year. These
#' include whether there was an alliance with a defense pledge, neutrality
#' pledge, non-aggression pledge, or pledge for consultation in time of crisis
#' (entente).
#'
#' @details Duplicates in the original directed dyad-year alliance data were
#' pre-processed. Check \code{cow_alliance} in the package's `data-raw`
#' directory on Github for more information.
#'
#' This function will also work with leader-dyad-years, though users should be
#' careful with leader-level applications of alliance data. Alliance data are
#' primarily communicated yearly, making it possible---even likely---that at
#' least one leader-dyad in a given year is credited with an alliance that was
#' not active in the particular leader-dyad. The Correlates of War's alliance
#' data are not communicated with time measurements more granular than the year.
#' Apply these data to leader-level analyses with that in mind.
