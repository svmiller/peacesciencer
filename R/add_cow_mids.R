#' Add Correlates of War (CoW) Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) data to dyad-year data frame

#'  `r lifecycle::badge("superseded")`
#'
#' \code{add_cow_mids()} merges in CoW's MID data to a dyad-year data frame.
#' The version of the CoW-MID data in this package is version 5.0.
#'
#' @return
#'
#' \code{add_cow_mids()} takes a dyad-year data frame and adds dyad-year dispute
#' information from the CoW-MID data.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' I've planted various flags in the ground about the use of these data versus
#' assorted alternatives.
#'
#' Dyads are capable of having multiple disputes in a given year, which can
#' create a problem for merging into a complete dyad-year data frame.
#' Consider the case of France and Italy in 1860, which
#' had three separate dispute onsets that year (MID#0112, MID#0113,
#' MID#0306), as illustrative of the problem. This merging process employs
#' several rules to whittle down these duplicate dyad-years for merging
#' into a dyad-year data frame.
#'
#' The function will also return a message to the user about the
#' case-exclusion rules that went into this process. Users who are
#' interested in implementing their own case-exclusion rules should
#' look up the "whittle" class of functions also provided in this
#' package.

#'
#' @param data a dyad-year data frame (either "directed" or "non-directed")
#' @param keep an optional parameter, specified as a character vector, passed to the function in a \code{select(one_of(.))} wrapper. This
#' allows the user to discard unwanted columns from the directed dispute data so that the output does not consume
#' too much space in memory. Note: the Correlates of War system codes (\code{ccode1}, \code{ccode2}), the observation year
#' (\code{year}), the presence or absence of an ongoing MID (\code{cowmidongoing}), and the presence or absence of a unique
#' MID onset (\code{cowmidonset}) are *always* returned. It would be foolish and self-defeating to eliminate those observations.
#' The user is free to keep or discard anything else they see fit.
#'
#' If \code{keep} is not specified in the function, the ensuing output returns everything.
