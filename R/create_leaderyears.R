#' Create leader-years from leader data
#'
#' @description \code{create_leaderyears()} allows you to generate leader-year
#' data from leader-level data provided in \pkg{peacesciencer}
#'
#' @return \code{create_leaderyears()} takes leader-level data available in
#' \pkg{peacesciencer} and returns a leader-year-level data frame. This minimal
#' output contains the observation ID from Archigos, the year, the state code
#' for the leader (i.e. either Correlates of War or Gleditsch-Ward, depending
#' on the \code{standardize} argument), the leader's name in Archigos (if it
#' may help the reader to have that), an approximation of the leader's age,
#' and the year in office for the leader (as a running count, starting at 1).
#'
#' @details \code{create_leaderyears()}, as of writing, only supports the
#' Archigos data set of leaders.
#'
#' Many leader ages are known with precision. Many are not recorded in the
#' Archigos data. Knowing well that years are aggregates of days, the leader
#' age variable that gets returned in this output should be treated as an
#' approximation of the leader's age.
#'
#' Be mindful that leader tenure is calculated *before* any standardization
#' argument. Archigos has some leader entries that precede the state system
#' entry for the state, or otherwise do not coincide with state system dates.
#' For example, Lynden Pindling was in his seventh year as leader of The
#' Bahamas (in various titles) before independence in 1973 (in which he became
#' prime minister). Leader tenure is not tethered to state system dates in
#' situations like this (only the dates recorded in the Archigos data).
#'
#' The leader tenure variable returned here does have the odd effect of
#' potentially misstating leader tenure, or at least making it seem unusual.
#' For example, Jimmy Carter (`USA-1877`) was president in 1977 (year 1),
#' 1978 (year 2), 1979 (year 3), 1980 (year 4), and exited in January 1981
#' (year 5). Again: years are aggregates of days and it's not evident how else
#' this information should be perfectly communicated with that in mind. Users
#' with some R skills can extract the underlying information from the
#' \code{archigos} data and, perhaps, calculate something like the maximum
#' leader tenure (in days) on either Dec. 31 of the referent year, or leader
#' exit before Dec. 31 that year, or something to that effect. No matter, I
#' think this to at least be a defensible variable to present to the user
#' with those limitations in mind. If the user is interested in leader tenure
#' in a leader-year analysis, this variable should be fine. If the user is
#' interested in something like the effect of a fifth year on some kind of
#' leader behavior, they will want to figure out something else.
#'
#' The Archigos data are anchored in the Gleditsch-Ward system of states, which
#' now includes (in this package by way of \pkg{isard}) the microstates. However,
#' the Archigos data do not include information for the leaders of microstates.

#' @param system a leader system with which to create leader-years.
#' Right now, only "archigos" is supported.
#' @param standardize a character vector of length one: "cow", "gw", or "none".
#' If "cow", the function standardizes the leader-years to just those that
#' overlap  with state system membership in the Correlates of War state
#' system (see: \code{cow_states}). If "gw", the function standardizes the
#' leader-years to just those that overlap with the state system dates of
#' the Gleditsch-Ward date (see: \code{gw_states}). If "none", the function
#' returns all leader-years as presented in Archigos (which is nominally
#' denominated in Gleditsch-Ward state system codes, if not necessarily
#' Gleditsch-Ward state system dates). Default is "none".
#' @param subset_years and optional character vector for subsetting the years
#' returned to just some temporal domain of interest to the user. For example,
#' `c(2000:2005)` would subset the data to just all leader-years in 2000, 2001,
#' 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 Be advised that it's easiest to subset the data after
#' the full universe of leader-year data have been created. It is also agnostic
#' about what was supplied to the `standardize` argument.

#' # standardize = 'none' is default

#' create_leaderyears(standardize = 'gw')
