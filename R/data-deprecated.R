#' @title Data sets that have been deprecated
#'
#' @description These are data sets that have been deprecated and scheduled for
#' removal, or data that have since been removed after deprecation. Data sets
#' may be deprecated either by insistence of the data set's author, because they
#' will be relocated to another package for future development, or because the
#' data themselves are legacy data no longer in active demand or use in the
#' community. Deprecation and removal have the effect of also freeing up disk
#' space given CRAN's 5 MB limitation for R packages.
