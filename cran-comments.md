## R CMD check results, Other Comments

R CMD check done via `devtools::check()`, resulting in 0 errors, 0 warnings, and 0 notes. 

`devtools::spell_check()` suggests several spelling errors. However, what I submit to CRAN includes only the false positives. Almost all of these false positives occur in the R Documentation files and concern proper nouns (e.g. data set authors) or peculiar terms that are unfamiliar in the R programming context (e.g. "dyad"). 

## Downstream dependencies
