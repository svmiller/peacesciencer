Indeed, almost every function package deals adding variables type data created peacesciencer includes . “left join” (left_join() dplyr), alternatively known “outer join” “left outer join” SQL context, type “mutating join” tidyverse context. plain English, left_join() assumes two data objects—“left” object (x) “right” object (y)—returns rows left object (x) matching information right object (y) set common matching keys (columns x y). simple example works peacesciencer context. Assume simple state-year data set United States (ccode: 2), Canada (ccode: 20), United Kingdom (ccode: 200) years 2016 2020.

However, corresponding information Australia “right object” (y). left join produce circumstances. ranking Australia simple example, left join returns NAs (.e. missing values) Australia. original number rows x conditions unaffected. happen observation y corresponding match x? example, let’s assume y data also included ranking Denmark (ccode: 390), though Denmark appear x. happen circumstances. Notice output left join identical output . Australia x, y. Thus, rows Australia returned absence ranking information Australia y means variable NA Australia merge. Denmark y, x. left join returns rows x matching information y, absence observations Denmark x means nowhere ranking information go merge.

Based CINC scores, computed larger--smaller capability ratios dyad-years classified three groups. capability ratio less equal three, dyad considered constitute case small power difference. ratio larger 10, power difference coded large, whereas ratio 3 10 coded medium power difference. either CINC scores missing (equal zero) ratio calculation, power difference score dyad coded missing also. easy case_when() function, also ’ve consumed space words manuscript allocated journal space allow. ’s added difficulty making sure identify side non-directed dyad-year powerful.

Clearly, ability test generalization 80% 90% needed data missing limited, especially case, missing data concentrated heavily pre-World War II era less advanced states. Given limitation, Bremer uses approach coding development/“advanced economies” measure. economically advanced state characterized possessing share system-wide economic capability greater share system-wide demographic capability. Hence, years found true, classified state advanced; otherwise, less advanced. next step involved examining pair states year assigning one three groups: advanced (7,160 dyad-years), one advanced (61,823 dyad-years), less advanced (128,939 dyad-years). Replicating approach going require group-summaries raw national material capabilities data, outside peacesciencer’s core functionality. Bremer’s wording little vague; doesn’t explain variable, variables, comprise “economic capability” “demographic capability.” Let’s assume “demographic capability” just total population variable whereas “economic capability” variables include iron steel production primary energy consumption. variable look something like . Now, let’s merge Bremer data frame created. ’ll make ordinal variable well 2, 1, 0 ordering scheme. Finally, manuscript creates militarization measure weak-link uses data military personnel total population. Bremer opts approach similar development indicator uses.

Thus, newly formed Republic Yemen (“Yemen”) gets new state code.2 G-W seem interpret unification less case formation new state, demise People’s Democratic Republic Yemen (“South Yemen”) integration Yemen Arab Republic (“North Yemen”). new code new entity, just continuation “Yemen (Arab Republic Yemen)” demise “Yemen, People’s Republic .” might seem like ’s distinction without much difference, matter standard peace science data. , example, happen merge G-W codes CoW state-year data cases.

Worse yet, easy way around ’s unique issue arises trying integrate two different state systems . another case systems collide : Serbia Yugoslavia. case, state systems differ major ways classifying entities dates. main difference interpret Yugoslavia .

Unlike COW, consider Serbia 1878 Austro-Hungarian invasion 1915 different polity Kingdom Croats, Serbs, Slovenes (renamed Yugoslavia 1929), established 1918. interesting difference interpretation whether Serbia disappear international system three-year period World War . CoW says “” G-W point government’s retreat Albania Austro-Hungarian/Bulgarian occupations suggestive “state” without territory (, thus, state). bigger difference interpretation concerns interpret “Yugoslavia.” CoW seems interpret Serbian “center” Yugoslavia, analogous interpretation (G-W’s interpretation) Prussian core German Empire. CoW, means Serbia precedes succeeds Yugoslavia Yugoslavia fundamentally territorial expansion Serbia result World War . G-W, 1915 retreat Serbian government 1918 creation State Slovenes, Croats Serbs amounts death one state (Serbia) formation new state (Yugoslavia) years later. Yugoslavia dies 2006 last remnant creation, Montenegro, emerges independent Serbia. Thus, Serbia reappears state system entity first time since 1915. integration run inverse situation Yemeni German unification 1990. cases, G-W see integration whereas CoW sees new state creation (case Yemen) old state restoration (case Germany). case, CoW sees one continuous state breaking apart whereas G-W see state death old state restoration.
