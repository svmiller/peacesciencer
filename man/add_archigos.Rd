\title{Add Archigos political leader information to dyad-year and state-year data}
\usage{
add_archigos(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dyad-year data frame (either "directed" or "non-directed") or state-year data frame}
}
\value{
\code{add_archigos()} takes a dyad-year or state-year data frame and
adds a few summary variables based off the leader-level data. These include
whether there was a leader transition in the state-year (or first/second
state in the dyad-year), whether there was an "irregular" leader transition,
the number of leaders in the state-year, the unique leader ID for Jan. 1 of
the year, and the unique leader ID for Dec. 31 of the year.
}
\description{
\code{add_archigos()} allows you to add some information about
leaders to dyad-year or state-year data. The function leans on an abbreviated
version of the data, which also comes in this package.
}
\details{
The function leans on attributes of the data that are provided by
the \code{create_dyadyears()} or \code{create_stateyears()} function. Make sure
that function (or data created by that function) appear at the top of the
proverbial pipe.
