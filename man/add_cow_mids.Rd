\title{Add Correlates of War (CoW) Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) data to dyad-year data frame}
\usage{
add_cow_mids(data, keep)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dyad-year data frame (either "directed" or "non-directed")}

\item{keep}{an optional parameter, specified as a character vector, passed to the function in a \code{select(one_of(.))} wrapper. This
allows the user to discard unwanted columns from the directed dispute data so that the output does not consume
too much space in memory. Note: the Correlates of War system codes (\code{ccode1}, \code{ccode2}), the observation year
(\code{year}), the presence or absence of an ongoing MID (\code{cowmidongoing}), and the presence or absence of a unique
MID onset (\code{cowmidonset}) are \emph{always} returned. It would be foolish and self-defeating to eliminate those observations.
The user is free to keep or discard anything else they see fit.

If \code{keep} is not specified in the function, the ensuing output returns everything.}
}
\value{
\code{add_cow_mids()} takes a dyad-year data frame and adds dyad-year dispute
information from the CoW-MID data.

\code{add_cow_mids()} merges in CoW's MID data to a dyad-year data frame.
The version of the CoW-MID data in this package is version 5.0.
}
\details{
I've planted various flags in the ground about the use of these data versus
assorted alternatives.

Dyads are capable of having multiple disputes in a given year, which can
create a problem for merging into a complete dyad-year data frame.
Consider the case of France and Italy in 1860, which
had three separate dispute onsets that year (MID#0112, MID#0113,
MID#0306), as illustrative of the problem. This merging process employs
several rules to whittle down these duplicate dyad-years for merging
into a dyad-year data frame.

The function will also return a message to the user about the
case-exclusion rules that went into this process. Users who are
interested in implementing their own case-exclusion rules should
look up the "whittle" class of functions also provided in this
package.
