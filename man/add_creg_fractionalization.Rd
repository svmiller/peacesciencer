\title{Add fractionalization/polarization estimates from CREG to a data frame}
\usage{
add_creg_fractionalization(data)

add_creg_frac(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame with appropriate \pkg{peacesciencer} attributes}

\item{...}{does nothing, called to make the shortcut (\code{add_creg_frac}) work}
}
\value{
\code{add_creg_fractionalization()} takes a dyad-year, leader-year,
leader-dyad-year, or state-data frame, whether the primary state
identifiers are from the Correlates of War system or the Gleditsch-Ward
system, and  returns information about the fractionalization and
polarization of the state(s) in a given year. The function returns four
additional columns when the data are state-year and returns eight
additional columns when the data are state-year (or leader-year).
The columns returned are the fractionalization of ethnic groups, the
polarization of ethnic groups, the fractionalization of religious groups,
and the polarization of religious groups. When the data are dyad-year
(or leader-dyad-year), the return doubles because it provides information
for both states in the dyad.

\description{
\code{add_creg_fractionalization()} allows you to add information about the
fractionalization/polarization of a state's ethnic and religious groups to
your data.
}
\details{
Please see the information for the underlying data \code{creg},
and the associated R script in the \code{data-raw} directory, to see how
these data are generated.

The \code{creg} data have a few duplicates. When standardizing to true CoW
codes, the duplicates concern Serbia/Yugoslavia in 1991 and 1992 as well as
Russia/the Soviet Union in 1991. When standardizing to true Gleditsch-Ward
codes, the duplicates concern Serbia/Yugoslavia in 1991 and Russia/Soviet
Union in 1991. In those cases, the function does a group-by arrange for
the more fractionalized/polarized estimate under the (reasonable, I think)
assumption that these are estimates prior to the dissolution of those
states. If this is problematic, feel free to consult the underlying data
and merge those in manually.

The underlying data have both Gleditsch-Ward codes and Correlates of War
codes. The merge it makes depends on what you declare as the "master"
system at the top of the pipe (i.e. in \code{create_dyadyears()} or
\code{create_stateyears()}). If, for example, you run
\code{create_stateyears(system="cow")} and follow it with
\code{add_gwcode_to_cow()}, the merge will be on the Correlates of War
codes and not the Gleditsch-Ward codes. You can see the script mechanics
to see how this is achieved.

Be mindful that the data are fundamentally state-year and that extensions
to leader-level data should be understood as approximations for leaders
in a given state-year.
