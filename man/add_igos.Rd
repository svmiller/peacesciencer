\title{Add Correlates of War international governmental organizations (IGOs) data to dyad-year or state-year data.}
\usage{
add_igos(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dyad-year data frame (either "directed" or "non-directed") or a state-year data frame.}
}
\value{
\code{add_igos()} takes a dyad-year data frame or state-year data frame and
adds information available from the Correlates of War International
Governmental Organizations data. If the data are dyad-year, the function
returns the original data with just one additional column for the total
number of mutual IGOs for which both members of the dyad are full members. If
the data are state-year, the function returns the original data with four
additional columns. These are the number of IGOs for which the state is a
full member, the number of IGOs for which the state is an associate member,
the number of IGOs for which the state is an observer, and the number of IGOs
for which the state is involved in any way (i.e. the sum of the other three
columns).
}
\description{
\code{add_igos()} allows you to add information from the
Correlates of War International Governmental Organizations data to dyad-year
or state-year data, matching on Correlates of War system codes.
}
\details{
The function leans on attributes of the data that are provided by the
\code{create_dyadyear()} or \code{create_stateyear()} function. Make sure
that function (or data created by that function) appear at the top of the
proverbial pipe.
