\title{Add minimum distance data to a dyad-year or state-year data frame}
\usage{
add_minimum_distance(data, system = "cow")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a dyad-year data frame (either "directed" or "non-directed") or state-year data frame}

\item{system}{a character specifying whether the user wants Correlates of War
state-years ("cow") or Gleditsch-Ward ("gw") state-years. Correlates of War is the
default.}
}
\value{
\code{add_minimum_distance()} takes a dyad-year or state-year data frame and adds the
minimum distance between the first state and the second state (in dyad-year data) or the minimum
minimum (sic) distance for a given state in a given year.
}
\description{
\code{add_minimum_distance()} allows you to add the minimum
distance (in kilometers) to a dyad-year or state-year data frame. These estimates
are recorded in the \code{cow_mindist} and \code{gw_mindist} data that come with this package. The
data are current as of the end of 2015.
}
\details{
The function leans on attributes of the data that are provided by the \code{create_dyadyear()} or
\code{create_stateyear()} function. Make sure that function (or data created by that function) appear at the top
of the proverbial pipe.
