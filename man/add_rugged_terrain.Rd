\title{Add rugged terrain information to a data frame}
\usage{
add_rugged_terrain(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data frame with appropriate \pkg{peacesciencer} attributes}
}
\value{
\code{add_rugged_terrain()} takes a (dyad-year, leader-year, leader-dyad-year,
state-year) data frame, whether the primary state identifiers are from the
Correlates of War system or the Gleditsch-Ward system, and returns
information about the "ruggedness" of the state's terrain. The two indicators
returned are the "terrain ruggedness index" calculated by Nunn and Puga
(2012) and a logarithmic transformation of how mountainous the state is
(as calculated by Gibler and Miller, 2014). The dyad-year (leader-dyad-year)
data get four additional columns (i.e. both indicators for both states in the
dyad) whereas the state-year data get just the two additional columns.
}
\description{
\code{add_rugged_terrain()} allows you to add information, however crude,
about the "ruggedness" of a state's terrain to your (dyad-year, leader-year,
leader-dyad-year, state-year) data.
}
\details{
Please see the information for the underlying data \code{rugged}, and the
associated R script in the \code{data-raw} directory, to see how these data
are generated. Importantly, these data are time-agnostic and move \emph{slowly}.
We're talking about geography here. Both data sets benchmark around
1999-2000 and it's a leap of faith to use these data for comparisons across
the entirety of the Correlates of War or Gleditsch-Ward system membership.
Every use of data of these types have been either cross-sectional snapshots
or for making state-to-state comparisons after World War II (think of your
prominent civil war studies here). Be mindful about what you expect to get
from these data.

The data have both Gleditsch-Ward codes and Correlates of War codes. The
merge it makes depends on what you declare as the "master" system at the top
of the pipe (e.g.. in \code{create_dyadyears()} or
\code{create_stateyears()}). If, for example, you run
\code{create_stateyears(system="cow")} and follow it with
\code{add_gwcode_to_cow()}, the merge will be on the Correlates of War codes
and not the Gleditsch-Ward codes. You can see the script mechanics to see how
this is achieved.
