\title{Correlates of War Non-Directed Dyad-Year International Governmental
Organizations (IGOs) Data}
\format{
A data frame with 917695 observations on the following 4 variables.
\describe{
\item{\code{ccode1}}{the Correlates of War state system code for the first state}
\item{\code{ccode2}}{the Correlates of War state system code for the second state}
\item{\code{year}}{the year}
\item{\code{dyadigos}}{the sum of mutual IGOs for which each state appears as a full member in a given year}
}
}

\description{
This is a non-directed dyad-year version of the Correlates of War IGOs data.
I use it internally for merging IGOs data into dyad-year data.
}
\details{
The \code{data-raw} directory on the project's Github contains
additional information about how these data were generated from the otherwise
enormous dyad-year IGOs data provided by the Correlates of War project. Given
the size of that data, and the size limitations of R packages for CRAN, the
data I provide here can only be simpler summaries. If you want specifics,
you'll need to consult the raw data provided on the Correlates of War project.
There's only so much I can do.
