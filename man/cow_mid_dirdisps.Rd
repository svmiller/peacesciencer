\format{
A data frame with 11390 observations on the following 18 variables.
\describe{
\item{\code{dispnum}}{a numeric vector for the CoW-MID dispute number}

\item{\code{ccode2}}{a numeric vector for the target state in the dyad}
\item{\code{year}}{a numeric vector for the dispute-year}
\item{\code{dispongoing}}{a numeric vector for whether there was a dispute ongoing in that year}
\item{\code{disponset}}{a numeric vector for whether it was the onset of a new dispute (or new participant-entry into a recurring dispute)}

\description{
These are directed dyadic dispute year data derived from the Correlates of War
(CoW) Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) project. Data are from version 5.0.
}
\details{
The process of creating these is described at one of the references below.
Importantly, these data are somewhat "naive." That is: they won't tell you,
for example, that Brazil and Japan never directly fought each other during
World War II. Instead, it will tell you that there were two years of overlap
for the two on different sides of the conflict and that the highest action for
both was a war. The data are thus similar to what the \emph{EUGene} program would
create for users back in the day. Use these
data with that limitation in mind.
