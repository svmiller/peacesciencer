\description{
This is an abbreviated version of the dispute-level CoW-MID data.
}
\details{
These data are purposely light on information; they're not intended to be
used for dispute-level analyses, per se. They're intended to augment the
directed dyadic dispute-year data by adding in variables that serve as
exclusion rules to whittle the data from dyadic dispute-year to just dyad-year
data.
