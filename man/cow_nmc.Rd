These are version 6.0 of the Correlates of War National Military Capabilities
data. Data omit the state abbreviation and version identifier for

\details{
The user will want to be a little careful with how some of these data are
used, beyond the typical caveat about how difficult it is to pin-point how
many thousands of coal-tons a state like Baden was producing in the 19th
century.

First, military expenditures are denominated in British pounds sterling for
observations between 1816 and 1913. The observations from 1914 and beyond are
denominated in current United States dollars. This is according to the manual.

Second, urban population size is an estimate based on, well, an estimate of
the size of the population living in an area with 100,000 or more people.

Third, the Composite Index of National Capability score is calculated as each
state's world share of each of the six composite indicators also included in
the data in a given year. It theoretically is bound between 0 and 1. A state
with a 1 is 100\% responsible for 1) all of the military expenditures in the
world, 2) is the only state with a military, 3) does all the iron and steel
production, 4) all the world's primary energy consumption, and 5) is the only
state in the world with a population and an urban population. Incidentally,
the maximum scores observed in the data belong to the United States in 1945.
