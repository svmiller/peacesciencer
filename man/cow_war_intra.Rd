\title{Correlates of War Intra-State War Data (v. 4.1)}
\format{
A data frame with 1361 observations on the following 17 variables.
\describe{
\item{\code{warnum}}{the Correlates of War war number}
\item{\code{warname}}{the Correlates of War war name}
\item{\code{wartype}}{a character vector for the type of war, either "local issues" or "central control"}
\item{\code{year}}{a numeric vector for the year}
\item{\code{cowintraonset}}{a dummy variable for whether this is a civil war onset (i.e. either the year in \code{StartYear1} or \code{StartYear2} in the raw data)}
\item{\code{cowintraongoing}}{a numeric constant of 1}
\item{\code{resume_combat}}{a dummy variable for whether this is a resumption of a conflict (i.e. \code{StartYear2} is not -8)}
\item{\code{primary_state}}{a dummy variable for whether the state is the primary state having the civil war}
\item{\code{ccodea}}{the Correlates of War state code for the participant on Side A. -8 = not applicable (participant is not a state)}
\item{\code{sidea}}{the name of the participant on Side A. -8 = not applicable (no additional party on this side)}
\item{\code{ccodeb}}{the Correlates of War state code for the participant on Side B. -8 = not applicable (participant is not a state)}
\item{\code{sideb}}{the name of the participant on Side B. -8 = not applicable (no additional party on this side)}
\item{\code{intnl}}{a dummy variable for if this is an internationalized civil war}
\item{\code{outcome}}{an unordered-categorical variable for the outcome of the civil war. Values include 1 (Side A wins),
2 (Side B wins), 3 (Compromise), 4 (war transformed into another type of war), 5 (war is ongoing at the end of 2007),
6 (stalemate), 7 (conflict continues below severity of war)}
\item{\code{sideadeaths}}{the estimated deaths for the Side A participant (-9 = unknown, -8 = not applicable)}
\item{\code{sidebdeaths}}{the estimated deaths for the Side B participant (-9 = unknown, -8 = not applicable)}
\item{\code{ongo2007}}{a dummy variable for if this war is ongoing as of the end of 2007}

\description{
These are a modified version of the intra-state war data from the Correlates
of War project. Data are version 4.1. The temporal domain is 1816-2007.
}
\details{
See \code{data-raw} directory for how these data were generated. In
the Guinea-Bissau Civil War (1998, 1999), the "Mane Junta" have the accented
"e" scrubbed to coincide with CRAN's character requirements.
