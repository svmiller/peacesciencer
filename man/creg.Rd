\description{
This is a data set with state-year estimates for ethnic and religious
fractionalization/polarization, by way of the Composition of Religious and
Ethnic Groups (CREG) project at the University of Illinois. I-L-L.

\details{
The \code{data-raw} directory on the project's Github contains more
information about how these data were created. Pay careful attention to how I
assigned CoW/G-W codes. The underlying data are version 1.02.

The state codes provided by the CREG project are mostly Correlates of War
codes, but with some differences. Summarizing these differences: the state
code for Serbia from 1992 to 2013 is actually the Gleditsch-Ward code (340).
Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union (1991-onward) is 393 and not
365. The Soviet Union has the 365 code. Yugoslavia has the 345 code. The code
for Yemen (678) is effectively the Gleditsch-Ward code because it spans the
entire post-World War II temporal domain. Likewise, the code for
post-unification Germany is the Gleditsch-Ward code (260) as well. The
codebook actually says it's 265 (which would be East Germany's code), but
this is assuredly a typo based on the data.

The codebook cautions there are insufficient data for ethnic group estimates
for Cameroon, France, India, Kosovo, Montenegro, Mozambique, and Papua New
Guinea. The French case is particularly disappointing but the missing data
there are a function of both France's constitution and modelling issues for
CREG (per the codebook). There are insufficient data to make religious group
estimates for China, North Korea, and the short-lived Republic of Vietnam.

The fractionalization estimates are the familiar Herfindahl-Hirschman
concentration index. The polarization formula comes by way of  Montalvo and
Reynal-Querol (2000), though this book does not appear to be published beyond
its placement online. I recommend Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2005) instead.
You can cite Alesina (2003) for the fractionalization measure if you'd like.

In the most literal sense of "1", the group proportions may not sum to
exactly 1 because of rounding in the data. There were only two problem cases
in these data worth mentioning. First, in both data sets, there would be the
occasional duplicates of group names by state-year (for example: Afghanistan
in 1951 in the ethnic group data and the United States in 1948 in the
religious group data). In those cases, the script I make available in the
\code{data-raw} directory just select distinct values and that effectively fixes
the problem of duplicates, where they do appear. Finally, Costa Rica had a
curious problem for most years in the religious group data. All Costa Rica
years have group data for Protestants, Roman Catholics, and "others." Up
until 1964 or so, the "others" are zero. Afterward, there is some small
proportion of "others". However, the sum of Protestants, Roman Catholics, and
"others" exceeds 1 (pretty clearly) and the difference between the sum and 1
is entirely the "others." So, I drop the "others" for all years. I don't
think that's terribly problematic, but it's worth saying that's what I did.
