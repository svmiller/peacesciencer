\description{
These are data sets that have been deprecated and scheduled for
removal, or data that have since been removed after deprecation. Data sets
may be deprecated either by insistence of the data set's author, because they
will be relocated to another package for future development, or because the
data themselves are legacy data no longer in active demand or use in the
community. Deprecation and removal have the effect of also freeing up disk
space given CRAN's 5 MB limitation for R packages.

that users who want the Correlates of War alliance data in their analyses
should download and process the data manually, without assistance of any
convenience functions.

\code{gml_dirdisp} is defunct. One of the data set's maintainers
requests that users who want to use the data should download and process the
data manually, without assistance of any convenience functions or software
that ultimately suggest design decisions on behalf of the researcher.

\code{gml_mid_ddydisps} is defunct. One of the data set's maintainers
requests that users who want to use the data should download and process the
data manually, without assistance of any convenience functions or software
that ultimately suggest design decisions on behalf of the researcher.
