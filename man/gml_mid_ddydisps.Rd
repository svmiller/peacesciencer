\description{
These are directed dyadic dispute year data derived from the
Gibler-Miller-Little (GML) Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) project. Data
are from version 2.2.1. These were whittled to where there is no duplicate
dyad-years. Its primary aim here is merging into a dyad-year data frame.
}
\details{
The process of creating these is described at one of the references
below. Importantly, these data are somewhat "naive." That is: they won't tell
you, for example, that Brazil and Japan never directly fought each other
during World War II. Instead, it will tell you that there were two years of
overlap for the two on different sides of the conflict and that the highest
action for both was a war. The data are thus similar to what the
\code{EUGene} program would create for users back in the day. Use these data with
that limitation in mind.
